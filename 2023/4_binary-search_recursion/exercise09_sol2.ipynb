    "\n",
    "Check out the [documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for managing environments with `conda`; you will find all the commands you need for this task on that website!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Using conda from the CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to your CLI (Windows: Anaconda Prompt; macOS/linux: Terminal)\n",
    "2. Run (i.e. type-and-press-enter) just `conda`; this will show you a list of available conda commands (build, clean, compare, ...) In this exercise, we only need the following commands: `conda list`; `conda env`; `conda install`; `conda remove`\n",
    "3. Run `conda list`; this will show you a list of packages available in your base (coding) environment. Check whether the following packages are in the list:\n",
    "    * `ipykernel`\n",
    "    * `matplotlib`\n",
    "    * `pandas`\n",
    "    * `requests`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Managing environments\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now run `conda env list`; this will show you a list of available **environments**, and their locations on your machine. You should see at least 1 environment, with the name \"base\". Let's add a new environment!\n",
    "5. Run `conda create --name empty_env`; this will **create** an **environment** with the name **empty_env**. When conda asks you to confirm proceed, press `Y` to confirm.\n",
    "6. Run `conda env list` once more - now `empty_env` should be on the list of environments as well!\n",
    "7. Run `conda activate empty_env` - this activates the environment.\n",
    "8. Run `conda list`; which, if any, packages are available in your new environment?\n",
    "9. Run `conda deactivate` - this brings you back to your base environment. Let's remove the empty_env:\n",
    "10. Run `conda remove --name empty_env --all` - this will remove the empty_env; then run `conda list` again to check if the environment has been successfully removed.\n",
    "11. Now let's create a more interesting environment - one that has the packages `ipykernel`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `requests`. For this, run (the syntax here is: `conda create --name <environmentname> <list of packages to add>`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create --name idsp_env ipykernel matplotlib pandas requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create an environment called `idsp_env`, containing the packages listed above. You can use the `conda env list` command once more to check whether the environment has been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Installing packages in an existing environment\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Activate your environment: `conda activate idsp_env`\n",
    "13. Which packages are available there? `conda list` (Why so many? Are the ones you explicitly installed there?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we want to add one more package to our `idsp_env` environment. The way to do it with conda is: `conda install <packagename>`. The package will be installed to the environment that you have currently activated. The package we want to install is called [`beautifulsoup4`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/); we will use it during the next lecture for getting text out of websites (\"webscraping\"). Make sure that `idsp_env` is activated, then run:\n",
    "\n",
    "14. `conda install beautifulsoup4` (if installation fails with conda, try to run `pip install beautifulsoup4` instead)\n",
    "15. Make sure that you managed to install `beautifulsoup4` within `idsp_env` by running `conda list` one more time\n",
    "16. Now you can deactivate `idsp_env` by running `conda deactivate`."
